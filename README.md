# Graphics_h

This particular project has been created as an submission for my Object-Oriented-Programming course's Digital Assignment. Objective of the assignment being to create a static graphics using C's graphics.h library. Further on, we were tasked to convert this static graphics to a dynamic form. 

SNOWMAN_static.cpp, is the static graphics. When executed, the code gives a graphic image of a scenery of backyard duting a snowfall with a snowman in the foreground, and the fencing in the background. 

SNOWMAN_dynamic.cpp, is the dynamic graphics. When executed, the code gives the same scenery, but the only differnece being that it is dynamic. Dynamic's being the snowfalling, the snowman's eyes blinking, and its nose changing colors.

The programs have been coded in Microsoft's Visual Studio Code, with TDM-GCC 32bit as the compiler.
